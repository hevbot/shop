"""Trending-search scoring: the pure reduce over search-history + clickstream.

RFC 0040 (in `../layer-pro/docs/rfcs/`) splits the
storefront's single "recent searches" surface into two honest reads: *personal
recent* (this browser's queries → client-side localStorage) and **Trending**
(everyone's queries → a Layer reduce UDF). This module is the pure,
side-effect-free core of that reduce: given the search-history (and, in Phase 2,
clickstream) events for a window, it produces the ranked `TrendingEntry` rows the
worker materializes into the `<ns>-trending` namespace.

It lives in `hev_shop_common` rather than in the worker so the math is
unit-testable without a gateway and reusable by any future reduce (top
categories, popularity priors). The worker (`indexer/trending.py`) owns the I/O
— the search-history/clickstream reads and the namespace upsert via the injected
hev layer client; this module owns only the aggregation.

Scoring (RFC 0040 §5), per normalized query `q`:

    count(q) = number of searches with that normalized query
    ndcg(q)  = mean NDCG over those searches (Phase 2; 0 in Phase 1)
    score(q) = count(q) * (1 + W * ndcg(q))

`W` (`TrendingConfig.quality_weight`) is 0 in Phase 1 — pure volume trending,
no click attribution required — and turned up in Phase 2 once clicks are
attributable to the search that produced them (shared `trace_id`).

See `docs/TRENDING_DESIGN.md`.
