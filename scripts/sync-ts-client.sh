# Refresh the vendored hev layer TypeScript client (app/vendor/hevlayer) from
# the sibling checkout. The client is unpublished, so the web app depends on it
# as an in-tree file: dep (file:vendor/hevlayer) and the web image bundles it at
# build time. Vendored — not injected from the sibling like the Python services
# — because npm bakes the file: link's relative path into the lockfile, and an
# out-of-tree ../../ link escapes the image filesystem root from /app.
#
# Run this whenever ../layer-pro/clients/typescript changes, then commit the result.
